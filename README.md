# Docker Perforce Images

A collection of [Perforce](http://perforce.com) docker images:

- Perforce Base, an image containing the official repo and the p4 client
- Perforce P4D Server
- Perforce Git Fusion
- Perforce Swarm

![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/mashape/kong.svg)

## Installation

All operations on the images and repositories are encapsulated in Makefiles.

Build images (the Makefile's default target):

    $ make [image]

Tag your images with your repo username and push the images to the Docker registry:

    $ docker login
    $ DOCKER_REPO=ambakshi make image push

## Usage

The perforce server images are contained in their respective directories.
Each server comes with an example 'run' target that you can use to get
a server up and running quickly.

    $ make -C perforce-server run
    $ make -C


### docker-compose

Using docker-compose it is much simpler to setup a working environment. Modify the
`docker-compose.yml` and the supplied `envfile` to customize your site. Once done,
run:

    $ make
    $ docker volume create --name=perforce
    $ docker volume create --name=gfp4depot
    $ docker-compose up -d perforce    # for p4d server
    $ docker-compose up -d gfperforce  # for p4d + git-fusion server

The perforce-git-fusion image is setup to run its own p4d server. If you prefer to
run a seperate git+ssh server and connect to a running p4d instance, please open a
PR.

You won't be able to run both `perforce` and `gfperforce` at the same time, because both
containers bind to host port 1666. If you need to run both please modify the `docker-compose.yml`.

If you want to use a directory on your host to mount into your perforce container,
you'll need to modify the `docker-compose.yml` file accordingly:

    services:
      perforce:
        volumes:
          /path/on/host:/data
      gfperforce:
        volumes:
          /path/on/host:/data

## Testing

Download a local p4 client for your OS from [Perforce's repo](http://cdist2.perforce.com/perforce/r16.2/),
and run:

    $ export P4CONFIG=envfile

    $ p4 info
    User name: p4admin
    Client name: titan7
    Client host: titan7.local
    Client unknown.
    Current directory: /home/abakshi/projects/docker-perforce
    Peer address: 172.18.0.1:38526
    Client address: 172.18.0.1
    Server address: perforce:1666
    Server root: /data/p4depot
    Server date: 2017/03/07 20:33:37 +0000 UTC
    Server uptime: 00:04:26
    Server version: P4D/LINUX26X86_64/2016.2/1487173 (2017/02/14)
    ServerID: p4depot
    Server services: standard
    Server license: none
    Case Handling: sensitive

Create a new client:

    $ p4 client myclient
    Perforce password (P4PASSWD) invalid or unset.
    Attempting login for user 'p4admin' against server '1666'
    Enter password:
    User p4admin logged in.
    Client myclient saved.

    $ p4 -c myclient add README.md
    //depot/README.md#1 - opened for add

    $ p4 -c myclient submit
